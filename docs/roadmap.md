# **Laborly Backend Development Roadmap**

## **Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering** (Week 1)
- Define backend architecture and technology stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, etc.).
- Finalize database schema and relationships.
- Draft API specifications and endpoints.
- Identify dependencies (authentication, database migrations, background tasks, etc.).
- Outline frontend-backend communication requirements (API responses, authentication flow, etc.).
- **Plan backend architecture** (microservices vs monolithic, modularity, scalability considerations).
- **Set up version control (Git & GitHub)** with repository structure and branching strategy.

## **Phase 2: Database Design & Setup** (Weeks 2-3)
- Implement SQLAlchemy models for all tables.
- Configure PostgreSQL and database connection in FastAPI.
- Implement Alembic migrations for database schema versioning.
- Seed initial data for testing (Admin users, sample jobs, etc.).
- Test database CRUD operations with unit tests.
- **Set up environmental variables (.env) management** for database credentials, JWT secrets, and other sensitive data.

## **Phase 3: Core API Development** (Weeks 4-6)
- **User Management**
  - Implement user registration, login, and authentication (JWT tokens).
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for Clients, Workers, Admins, etc.
  - Implement password hashing and user verification.
- **Job Management**
  - Implement job posting, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
  - Define job lifecycle transitions (Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed → Disputed).
  - Implement job search and filtering by category, location, and status.
- **Job Applications & Assignments**
  - Enable workers to apply for jobs.
  - Clients can manually approve/reject worker applications.
  - Workers can accept/reject assigned jobs.
- **Worker Availability System**
  - Implement worker availability tracking.
  - Track last active time and status.
- **Logging Implementation**
  - Set up structured logging with log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG, etc.).
  - Log all key actions (user authentication, job lifecycle changes, admin interventions, etc.).
  - Implement request/response logging for API debugging.
  - Store logs in a persistent format (database, files, or cloud-based logging system).

## **Phase 4: Reviews & Ratings System** (Week 7)
- Implement rating and review system.
- Ensure only completed jobs can be reviewed.
- Store and update average ratings efficiently.
- Write API endpoints for retrieving and filtering reviews.

## **Phase 5: Admin & Dispute Management** (Week 8)
- Implement admin dashboard endpoints for:
  - User verification management.
  - Dispute resolution and job status overrides.
  - Log admin actions for accountability.

## **Phase 6: Security & Performance Enhancements** (Week 9)
- Implement rate limiting and request validation.
- Harden authentication mechanisms (refresh tokens, logout functionality, etc.).
- Secure sensitive endpoints and apply access control policies.
- Optimize database queries for high-performance scaling.
- Conduct security audits and vulnerability testing.
- **Enhance logging for security monitoring** (failed logins, suspicious activities, API abuse attempts).

## **Phase 7: Automated Testing & Code Refactoring** (Weeks 10-11)
- Write unit tests for all major services and endpoints.
- Implement integration tests using pytest and FastAPI’s test client.
- Improve API error handling and logging.
- Perform code review and refactoring for maintainability.
- Ensure frontend API consumption aligns with backend responses.
- **Enable log analysis for debugging and performance monitoring.**

## **Phase 8: API Documentation & Frontend Integration** (Weeks 12-13)
- Work with frontend team to integrate API endpoints.
- Validate API responses against frontend UI.
- Implement CORS policies for secure frontend-backend communication.
- Document frontend-backend interaction flows.
- Optimize API response times for better user experience.
- **Monitor logs for API errors during integration testing.**
- **Write comprehensive API documentation** using OpenAPI (Swagger UI) and Markdown.
- **Include request/response examples for each endpoint** to assist frontend developers.
- **Ensure API versioning is in place** for future updates.

## **Phase 9: Deployment Preparation** (Weeks 14-15)
- Finalize database migrations and ensure all features work in staging.
- Optimize backend performance (caching, query indexing, etc.).
- **Complete API documentation with usage guidelines.**
- Prepare deployment scripts for cloud integration (to be implemented in final weeks).
- **Finalize backend documentation** (architecture overview, API design, workflows, best practices).
- **Ensure logging infrastructure is ready for production monitoring.**

## **Phase 10: Cloud Deployment & DevOps Integration** (Final Weeks)
- Containerize the backend with Docker.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Deploy PostgreSQL database and backend services on AWS/DigitalOcean.
- Integrate monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
- **Set up centralized logging for production (CloudWatch, ELK Stack, or other tools).**

## **Final Phase: System Testing & Launch**
- Perform end-to-end testing in a production-like environment.
- Conduct stress testing and monitor API performance.
- Collect feedback from initial users and iterate based on insights.
- Officially launch and maintain the system with continuous improvements.
- **Regularly review logs for system health, security, and performance monitoring.**
